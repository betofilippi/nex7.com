## üí¨ How to Chat with Agents

### Starting a Conversation

1. **Navigate to Agents**: Go to [/agents](http://localhost:3000/agents)
2. **Select an Agent**: Click on the agent that best matches your need
3. **Start Chatting**: Type your message and press Enter

### Conversation Tips

**Be Specific**: Instead of "Help me with my code", try:
```
"Review this React component and suggest performance improvements"
```

**Provide Context**: Include relevant code, error messages, or background:
```
"I'm getting this TypeScript error in my Next.js app:
[paste error message]

Here's my component code:
[paste code]
```

**Ask Follow-up Questions**: Agents remember conversation context:
```
You: "How do I create a React hook?"
Agent: [explains hooks]
You: "Can you show an example with useState?"
Agent: [provides specific example]
```

## üîÑ Agent Collaboration

Agents can work together on complex problems:

### Multi-Agent Workflows

**Design + Development**:
1. Ask **Designer** for UI mockups
2. Share the design with **Dev** for implementation
3. Get **Teacher** to explain complex concepts
4. Use **Debugger** for any issues

**Example Collaboration**:
```
1. Designer: "Create a dashboard layout for user analytics"
   ‚Üí Returns design specifications

2. Dev: "Implement this dashboard design in React"
   ‚Üí Returns code implementation  

3. Debugger: "This component has performance issues"
   ‚Üí Identifies and fixes problems
```

### Agent Switching

Switch between agents mid-conversation:
- Use the agent selector dropdown
- Previous context is maintained
- Agents can reference earlier conversations

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Agent Features

### Memory and Context

Each agent maintains:
- **Conversation History**: Remembers previous messages
- **User Preferences**: Learns your coding style and preferences  
- **Project Context**: Understands your current project setup
- **Code Awareness**: Knows about your codebase structure

### Tool Integration

Agents have access to powerful tools:

**Code Analysis**:
```typescript
"Analyze my codebase for potential security issues"
"Generate documentation for this API endpoint"
"Suggest refactoring opportunities"
```

**Project Management**:
```typescript
"Create a project plan for this feature"
"Estimate development time for these tasks"
"Break down this epic into smaller stories"
```

**Deployment & DevOps**:
```typescript
"Help me set up CI/CD for this project"
"Debug my Vercel deployment issues"
"Optimize my build configuration"
```

### Real-time Collaboration

**Live Code Review**: Share your screen and get real-time feedback
**Pair Programming**: Work together on complex problems
**Code Suggestions**: Get instant suggestions as you type

## üéØ Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Agent

| Need | Recommended Agent | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Learning new concept | Teacher | Patient, educational approach |
| Code review | Dev | Technical expertise, best practices |
| UI/UX problems | Designer | Visual design skills, user focus |
| Error debugging | Debugger | Systematic problem-solving |
| General guidance | Nexy | Friendly, comprehensive help |

### Effective Communication

**Do:**
- Be specific about your goals
- Provide relevant code and context
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share error messages completely
- Describe your experience level

**Don't:**
- Ask overly broad questions
- Skip important context
- Expect agents to guess your setup
- Share sensitive information (API keys, passwords)

### Managing Conversations

**Organization**:
- Use descriptive conversation titles
- Start new conversations for different topics
- Archive completed conversations
- Use tags to categorize discussions

**Context Switching**:
- Clearly state when changing topics
- Reference previous conversations when relevant
- Provide context when switching agents

## üîß Customization
